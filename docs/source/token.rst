ANote Music Token (ANMT)
========================

The ANote Music token is the bridge between different services of the ANote Music ecosystem.
You can already see some of its usages in the :doc:`how`:

* Paying royalties collected from music usage
* Airdropping when we pay royalties (decreases over time)
* Reward contributors to ANM ecosystem, by granting them more of the token itself
* Buy ANM catalogues on platform at current token price

The token is a ERC-20 token on BNB.
It will soon be available wrapped on other chains we interact with (Algorand, Bitsong).

Tokenomics
----------

The token has a hard cap of emittable tokens. While we commit to burn monthly an allowance after 3 years, and still have to redistribute for paying 
artists' dividends to investors base, it is deflationary by nature.

See :doc:`how`

Table of issuance
-----------------

The issuance is as follows:

* ANM holders (airdrop): tokens to be distributed to already active customers
* Sellers (foundation for artists): tokens to onboard new famous artists and help grow ecosystem
* Fund raising (sales @ 0.02€, 0.03€ and 0.1€): Helps ANM company have funds by some strategic sales
* Comm. Building: tokens for any active user helping to grow the community
* Staking farms (liquidity): reserved for liquidity
* ANM Company (ecosystem, team, advisors): tokens for the team and related, the only pool that can be used for paying royalties

You can realize that there is no provision for paying royalties. This means that ANote Music will need to acquire more tokens to redistribute,
making it even more deflationary and value-growing.
