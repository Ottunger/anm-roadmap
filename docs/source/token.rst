ANote Music Token (ANMT)
========================

The ANote Music token is the bridge between different services of the ANote Music ecosystem.
You can already see some of its usages in the :doc:`how`:

.. toctree::

   Paying royalties collected from music usage
   Airdropping when we pay royalties (decreases over time)
   Reward contributors to ANM ecosystem, by granting them more of the token itself
   Buy ANM catalogues on platform at current token price

The token is a ERC-20 token on BNB.
It will soon be available wrapped on other chains we interact with (Algorand, Bitsong).

Tokenomics
----------

The token has a hard cap of emittable tokens. While we commit to burn monthly some and also have to redistribute for paying 
artists' dividends to investors base, it is deflationary by nature.
