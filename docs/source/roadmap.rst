Roadmap
=======

Building a rewarding ecosystem for all involved parties is never an easy task nor a short one but
we are committed to making the journey as smooth and interesting as possible for everyone!

Q4/2021
-------
As we transition from traditional centralized exchange to DeFi,
we will convert all existing sold catalogues’ shares into NFTs and transfer them to cold
wallets created for our investors. This process will be done on Algorand, a mother blockchain
for artists and music, and will allow easy interconnection with already existing NFTs emitted for artists such as those of SIAE.

We also prepare the field for our initial AirDrops. While we test our token integration in our test environments,
we will prepare the guides for every receiving user to claim his/her due on the appropriate platforms,
and prepare the security guidelines that possessing crypto assets require.

Q1/2022
-------
We will officially launch the ANMT token and start listing it on different exchanges and crypto usage platforms
.. toctree::

   Binance coin (and initial airdrop)
   Yieldly
   PancakeSwap
   Uniswap (chainport to ETH)
   Kucoin (lending)

Our first farming pools are supposed to follow suit, with more details on the way.

In parallel, our auctions will start to be run on multiple platforms to engage even more with the DeFi community.
We plan our first auctions to also run on XXX and YYY.

As these platforms do not work natively on the Algorand blockchain, the assets sold there are not natively exchangeable
with the assets sold on ANote Music platform directly. However, bridges are here on this roadmap.

Q2/2022
-------
We will start accepting ANMT to buy into the catalogues listed on ANM Platform, at “today’s rate”.
This means ANM itself will start reducing the circulating amount of ANMT, increasing even further its value.

Concerning the DeFi community, we will enlarge the initial listing to other platforms, too.
Rather than having pre-agreed percentages that are listed in our auction phases, we will have one centralized measure
of auction progress that all platforms will update together.

At the same time, we will start paying royalties in ANMT rather than fiat EUR/USD.
Everyone will be able to opt-in for this change, and wrapped versions wANMT will be used to pay on Algorand.
The bridge will be operated by Yieldly/Algomint/deBridge/ANM itself?, the in-house developed bridge from Algorand to EVM-compatible chains.

Q3/2022
-------
As we were wrapping ANMT into wANMT for paying royalties, we will start wrapping NFTs so that they will be exchangeable between any environment.
Beware though of the whitelisting needed to acquire these.

As we reach out to more artists, too, we will start introducing artists’ rewards for people staking enough ANMT.
Our top investors will get exclusive benefits such as meeting their favorite artists or attending concerts VIP free of charge.
