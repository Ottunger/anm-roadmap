How it works
============

ANote Algorand NFTs
-------------------

ANote Music uses Algorand Standard Assets to mint NFTs that represent artists’ rights on their creations.
Only so can we remain truly decentralized and guarantee the perennity of the value for our investors community.

When an NFT is minted, it is given a unique identifier, and is created in a discrete and finite amount,
the equivalent of shares in a traditional stock market. Each token is then enriched with metadata off-chain that makes it easier
for humans to understand what the token represents. But make no mistake, the token’s ownership is what gives the right to future royalties.
On ANote Music platform, purchasers are granted these NFTs in a cold wallet that they cannot manipulate (we keep private keys).
We are doing so as ASA (Algorand Standard Assets) cannot easily be restricted from trades,
and we are required to assess all investors for AML/KYC legal reasons.
It obviously is in our roadmap to allow you all to receive the assets in your personal wallet of choice.

When the music represented by an NFT is played, ANote Music collects the rights in the name of all the NFT holders
and periodically pays out the royalties directly to each token holder.


ANote Token (ANMT)
------------------

The ANMT “ANote Music Token” represents the royalties flowing in the ANM ecosystem.
Like in Algorand, it is imbued with “native staking” meaning that owning ANMT at any time is sufficient to get rewards.
The ANMT is at the base of the ecosystem and constantly exchanges hands as transactions happen. The ANote Token is used for:


* Paying royalties collected from music usage
* Airdropping when we pay royalties (decreases over time)
* Reward contributors to ANM ecosystem, by granting them more of the token itself
* Buy ANM catalogues on platform at current token price

*Our official mainnet address is: 0xfff
*/!\ Be sure to transact only with the official contract!*
*Our github repository for the token, as analyzed by bscscan, is here: https://xxx*

The token code is a valid ERC20 (BEP20) token that has a no limit supply, but enforces our token release schedule.
The minted amounts at each tranche are already pre encoded, and the minting after the 3y cap as described here can only be performed if burning has indeed occurred.

After 3 years, ANM will periodically burn 2.5M tokens per month, buying them back if not enough in its possession.
Token issuance after 3 years will only happen to sellers, with up to 35M tokens/y.
This means the rate is bound to only grow if enough catalogues (hence, contribution to artists) are sold.

Lockup for ANM company!

I missed the sale and AirDrop, where to acquire some tokens?

* Head to Binance for a known exchange, to sell BNB against ANMT
